## The Scripts

- *game_script.rb* - run in the command line to play a game of Mastermind versus the computer
- *ai_tester_script.rb* - Run in the command line to see stats on how the AI does across 100 random games of Mastermind. You can easily edit it if you'd like to run more or fewer tests, or to change the test game perameters (i.e. increase code length or change the elements comprising a code).
