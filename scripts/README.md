## The Scripts

- *game_script.rb* - Run in the command line to play a game of Mastermind versus the computer. You can easily edit the script to change the game's code length, code elements, and maximum number of turns. 
- *ai_tester_script.rb* - Run in the command line to see stats on how the AI does across 100 random games of Mastermind. You can easily edit this script as well to alter the number of tests or the test games' code length and code elements.
